# Attaching a GPU to a VM

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-2x" aria-hidden="true">Warning</i><br>

**The HPC Cloud service stopped offering / supporting Marketplace images with GPU drivers pre-installed**, see our [changelog](changelog).
Contact the Service Helpdesk [helpdesk@surfsara.nl](mailto:helpdesk@surfsara.nl) for options.
 
</div>

Using GPU devices to do (part of) your computation on, enables a form of parallelization that could be much faster than multiple CPU core usage. However, the software you are using must be enabled to use GPU's and programming for GPU's is difficult and often not ideal for novice programmers. If you are not sure whether or not you could profit from using GPU's, please feel free to contact us at [helpdesk@surfsara.nl](mailto:helpdesk@surfsara.nl).

This page teaches how to attach a GPU device to a VM. It does not show you how to get or write software that uses GPU's.

For more information on our hardware, see our [resource overview](resources-available).

## Getting access

By default, you will not have access to the GPU nodes of the HPC Cloud. In order to get this, please send an e-mail to [helpdesk@surfsara.nl](mailto:helpdesk@surfsara.nl).

If GPU access was enabled for your account, you will have to use a [datastore](image_storage) that is enabled on the GPU nodes. This datastore is called `images_ssd_gpu` and behaves the same way as the `local_images_ssd` datastore, except that it is accessible on the GPU nodes only. In other words, using this datastore, makes sure that your VM is run on the nodes which have GPU's installed on them.

Note that the `ceph` datastore is also enabled on the GPU nodes. However, as described [here](image_storage), it is best to put your OS image on either the `local_images_ssd` or the `images_ssd_gpu` datastore. `ceph` can still be used for larger, data images and for persistent data.

### Import appliances from the Apps option

If you want to import an appliance from the Apps option of the Storage section for use on the GPU nodes, you can follow the normal instructions as described on [this page](general-start).

The only exception is that you have to select a different datastore. In the screen shown below, make sure you choose the 'images_ssd_gpu' datastore.

![GPU import from apps](images/gpu/rvs_image_name.png)

### Using an existing image

When you already have an image that you want to use on the GPU nodes, you will have to create a clone in the correct datastore:

 1. Go to 'Storage' > 'Images' for an overview of your images
 1. Select the image you want to copy
 1. Click on 'Clone' at the top of the table with images.
 1. Click on the 'Advanced options' button. This will show you a screen like this:

    ![Clone image to GPU datastore](images/gpu/gpu_clone_image.png)

 1. Select the correct datastore 'images_ssd_gpu'
 1. Optionally, change the name of the image
 1. Click the 'Clone' button
 1. Optionally, you can now delete the old image. This is not necessary, but note that changes in one image will not affect the other!

## Adding a GPU device to your VM

GPU devices are attached to VM using 'pci passthrough'. This means that your VM will have direct access to the hardware, instead of through a virtualisation layer. This should give an optimal performance. You have the option of attaching a Nvidia GRID K2 (1536 CUDA cores, 4GB) or Tesla P100 GPU (3584 CUDA cores, 12GB).
Please be aware that the Nvidia GRID K2 GPUs are older and the existing drivers might not support your application.

> **NOTE:**
>
> Before proceeding, make sure that your OS image is on the `images_ssd_gpu` datastore and possible extra images are on the `ceph` datastore.

To attach a GPU device to your VM, either create a new template or edit an existing template as described [on this page](customize-your-vm). Then:

 1. Go to the 'Other' tab while editing the template. You should see a screen like below:

    ![Add GPU to template](images/gpu/gpu_add_pci.png)

 1. Click on the '+ Add PCI device' button. This adds a line to the table above it (already visible in the screenshot above).
 1. In the new line, under 'Device name', choose the GPU in the dropdown list. The 'Vendor', 'Device' and 'Class' will automatically be set. Please note the chosen GPU type as the driver installation instructions differ for both types.
 1. If no other changes to the template are needed, click on the green 'Create' or 'Update button (depending on whether you are creating a new template or editing an existing one) will save the template.

## Inside your VM

To make full use of the GPU capabilities please install the corresponding drivers and toolkit for your distribution from the official Nvidia repositories which can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). From there please follow the post installation [instructions](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#package-manager-installation)

## Example for installing NVIDIA drivers on Ubuntu 18.04

* Launch your VM and force an installation of any security updates, reboot the VM afterwards:

```bash
sudo systemctl start apt-daily.service && sleep 60 && sudo reboot
```

* Now follow the instructions for the type of GPU you attached to your VM.

### GPU Specific

#### Grid K2

* Remove any old drivers, install prerequisites, then download and install the drivers:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge nvidia-* libcuda-*
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gcc make g++ libglu1-mesa libxi-dev libxmu-dev libglu1-mesa-dev software-properties-common gpg-agent gnupg2 unzip
wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/367.130/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-367.130.run
sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-367.130.run -s
```

#### Tesla P100

* Remove any old drivers, add the Nvidia repository and install the drivers:

```bash
sudo apt purge nvidia-* libcuda1-*
wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/375.66/nvidia-diag-driver-local-repo-ubuntu1604_375.66-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i nvidia-diag-driver-local-repo-ubuntu1604_375.66-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y cuda-drivers
```

### All GPU types

* Check with `nvidia-smi` that the card is detected. It should show something like this:

```bash
$ nvidia-smi

Linux kernel 4.4.0-143 seems to be backward-incompatible for compiling the NVidia drivers! Therefore, please do the following to stick to 4.4.0-142 (note that the operating system will reboot):

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sara-nl/clouddocs/gh-pages/assets/ubuntu16gpukernelpin.sh
chmod +x ubuntu16gpukernelpin.sh
sudo ./ubuntu16gpukernelpin.sh
```

The previous lines make sure you have the proper kernel version installed. The following lines make sure your configuration stays as it should:

```bash
sudo apt-mark hold linux-image-4.4.0-142-generic linux-headers-4.4.0-142 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-142-generic
```

</div>

## Install CUDA 8 on Ubuntu


* Install CUDA prerequisites, download and install CUDA 8:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y gcc make g++ build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/8.0/Prod2/local_installers/cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux-run
sudo service lightdm stop
sudo sh cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux-run --silent --samples --toolkit --override
```

* Reboot your VM once more: `sudo reboot`

>**NOTE:**
>
>Make sure the libraries and binaries paths are part of your environment (these should be added as part of the installation), if they are not they can be added with:
>
> - `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin`
> - `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64`

* CUDA should be ready to use, as a test we will compile and run one of the sample utilities:

```bash
cd NVIDIA_CUDA-8.0_Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
make
./deviceQuery
```

* If everything is running as intended the result will look similar to this:

```bash
./deviceQuery Starting...

To prevent any (automatic) kernel upgrades, run `sudo apt-mark hold linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic`.

### Running a Hello World

>**Note:**
>For Ubuntu 18.04 you must install an earlier version of `g` and `g++`, so:
>
```bash
sudo apt install gcc-5 g++-5
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-5 /usr/local/cuda/bin/gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-5 /usr/local/cuda/bin/g++
```

* Download, uncompress and compile Nvidia's Hello World example:

```bash
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/developertrainingmaterials/samples/cuda_c/HelloWorld.zip
unzip HelloWorld.zip
nvcc hello.cu
```

* Run the compiled program, which if the compilation succeeded will be called `a.out`:

```bash
./a.out
```

That yields the output:

```bash
$ ./a.out
H
E
L
L
O

W
O
R
L
D
!
```
